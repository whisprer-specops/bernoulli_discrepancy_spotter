🔍 Laplace-Enhanced Signal Denoising & Encryption Analysis Toolkit
This project implements a robust signal cleaning pipeline that estimates and removes Laplace-distributed noise using robust regression, followed by basis pursuit denoising (BPDN) to extract significant frequency components from incoming real-time data streams. It is designed with applications in encryption detection, signal recovery, and preprocessing for secure communication.

🔧 Components Overview
✅ laplace_estimator.c/h
Estimates Laplace location (median) and scale (via MAD / log(2)).

Preprocessing step to obtain noise model for later removal.

✅ stream_bpwp.c/h
Manages a circular buffer of data with timestamps, values, and error estimates.

Provides robust linear regression and residual computation per time point.

✅ bpwp_solver.c/h
Applies basis pursuit with L2 minimization on cleaned signals to extract frequency/amplitude pairs.

Uses GSL (GNU Scientific Library) linear algebra tools.

🔄 Suggested Processing Pipeline
From raw data stream → encryption check:

plaintext

Edit
[Incoming Stream]
      ↓
[Laplace Estimator] → Estimate (location, scale)
      ↓
[Robust Regression] → Remove Laplace noise
      ↓
[Basis Pursuit Solver] → Extract dominant frequencies
      ↓
[Encryption Detector] → Check if signal shows signs of AES/rand
📌 Key Use-Case: Encrypted Signal Detection
This system is ideal for cases where noisy or masked signals may contain encrypted payloads.

Once Laplace noise is removed, patterns indicative of AES or other encryption methods become clearer (due to statistical traits like high entropy, uniformity, block structure).

The combination of frequency analysis + cleaned signal makes this useful for digital forensics, security, or anomaly detection.

💡 Pro Tips
Order matters: For encrypted streams masked by Laplace noise, the best recovery strategy is:

sql
Copy
Edit
Encrypt first → then apply Laplace noise → then transmit
That way, decryption can proceed after denoising without irreversible fusion of noise into the plaintext.

Track noise parameters (scale/location) securely and reproducibly.
These are critical to reverse the noise properly.

🚀 Quick Start
Build the C files using gcc and link against GSL:

bash
Copy
Edit
gcc -o laplace_est laplace_estimator.c -lgsl -lgslcblas -lm
gcc -o stream stream_bpwp.c -lgsl -lgslcblas -lm
gcc -o bpwp bpwp_solver.c -lgsl -lgslcblas -lm
Run the estimator on a known noisy signal to get noise parameters.

Feed that into the regression + BPDN flow.

Analyze results, extract frequency spectrum, or pass to your encryption detector.

Real-time Laplace noise estimation with sliding windows

Adaptive frequency dictionary (not just static sine basis)

GPU-accelerated denoising for large streams
